Huge ListView
=============

A performant `ListView` that can handle any number of items with ease. Unlike other inifinite list approaches,
it doesn't just add new items to the list, growing to huge sizes in the end, but has a fixed size cache that
only keeps a handful of pages all the time, discarding old pages as new ones come in. The list asks for a pageful
of items at once, in an async function, expecting to return a `Future<List<T>>` of your items.

Instead of a regular `ListView`, it uses a `ScrollablePositionedList` inside that makes it possible to scroll
to specific items rather than scroll positions. The items don't have to be of uniform height, their size differences
don't affect performance at all. This list implementation, however, doesn't play nice with the regular `Scrollbar`,
so we use our own Ë‡DraggableScrollbar` instead. This we we can support both a scrollbar and the usual position-based
scrolling as well.

The basic idea came from:

The scrollbar is based on:

## Usage

``` dart
static const int PAGE_SIZE = 12;

// Only needed if you expect to make use of its `setPosition` function.
final listKey = GlobalKey<HugeListViewState>();

// Only needed if you expect to make use of its `jumpTo` or `scrollTo` functions.
final scroll = ItemScrollController();

HugeListView<MyDataItem>(
  key: listKey,
  controller: scroll,
  pageSize: PAGE_SIZE,
  totalCount: 999999,
  startIndex: 0,
  pageFuture: (page) => _loadPage(page, PAGE_SIZE),
  itemBuilder: (context, index, entry) {
    return Text(entry.name);
  },
  placeholderBuilder: (context, index) => <some Widget>,
  waitBuilder: (context) => <some Widget>,
  firstShown: (index) {},
);
```

You have to pass a list of your items to `pageFuture`, for instance, given a list named `data`:

``` dart
Future<List<XmlItem>> _loadPage(int page, int pageSize) async {
  final result = <MyDataItem>[];
  int from = page * pageSize;
  int to = min(data.length, from + pageSize);
  for (int i = from; i < to; i++) {
    result.add(data.elementAt(i));
  }
  return result;
}
```
